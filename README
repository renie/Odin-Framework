Notes: 
    - PHPDoc and PHPUnit were set aside for the time being, BUT THEY ARE NOT DEAD!
        - This does NOT mean you are able to not document ALL your fucking method AND classes.

Notices:

    - For the time being, Odin manager of controllers and Actions id based on
        friendly url structure (appName/controller/action/par_name1/val_par_name1/par_name2/val_par_name2[...]).
        So, make sure mod_rewrite is enable and directory apache config for 'AllowOverride' is setted as 'all'.

    - Please, add to .gitignore all those directories about yours IDE config
